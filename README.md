Review

dplyr is an amazing package for data manipulation. Essentially every dataset one works with will involve changing it in some way to allow for application of some specific aspect of the data to your own needs and interests. dplyr enables one to do this in a concise and efficient manner since it is easy to home in on the part of the data you want to change or extract from the greater dataset using its core functions. I really enjoy using dplyr because of how easy it is to get what I need from large and complex datasets, and change features of them directly in R to make them more workable for what I am applying the data to. I wouldn’t change most anything about dplyr; that may mostly be because I do not have the extensive knowledge the creators of this package have to see holes in their code design. One thing I did find unusual and redundant was the use of the “%.%” operator since it seems to do the same as the piping operator “%>%” of tidyverse, which dplyr falls under. There may be a reason for this distinction, but on the surface at least it seems to be an unnecessary use of another operator. I have seen pages online that state that the “%.%” operator use with dplyr functions makes it “behave a little like a grammar of data manipulation”, a statement that is lost on me.
